# CapstoneProject
Senior Capstone Project IRB Site

Please read before starting.

Hello everyone, this is our github account for the capstone IRB project. 

For anyone seeing this, you already have created a github account. I recommend going through this page https://guides.github.com/activities/hello-world/ to get a starting idea of how this works. Also this github flow guide https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/ will explain further. There is a desktop app for github that can make this easy after you understand all the jargon for using github. Feel free to contact a member of the group for help anytime for help. This is new to most of us but I believe we can work through this together.

These directories contain the files for our django project including the html, css, js, and any other files associated with the webpage itself. I know these directories can seem a little convoluted and redundantly named but they are that way for a reason. If you create a fork to work on the project please do not "clean them up", or reorganize/rename them. The youtube series I mainly used to create this project can be found here https://www.youtube.com/watchv=Fc2O3_2kax8&index=1&list=PLw02n0FEB3E3VSHjyYMcFadtQORvl1Ssj
If you want to take part in this or just understand what is going on with these files please watch this or ask any questions anytime.
